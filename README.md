## Overview

Blockland Glass is a service made for Blockland to help expand and cultivate the community.
Glass acts as a mod management service / content distribution system.
It also also gives users' friends lists, direct messaging and a chatroom to socialize in.

## Installing

The latest stable version will always be found on the official website @ https://blocklandglass.com/

Likewise, you can also download it from this repo's "development" branch to receive changes as soon as they are committed.
Download the .zip, change the name to 'System_BlocklandGlass' (if you've downloaded it from the repo directly), then transfer it to your Add-Ons folder.

__The "development" branch is not guaranteed to be stable, and may load you into a development server and not the public one that every body else will be connected to.__
